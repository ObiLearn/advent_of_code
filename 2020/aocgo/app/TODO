@Jan Christoph Uhde have another goroutine that you start first to collect the
items sent over the unbuffered channel. Once that channel is closed, write the
final results to another channel that main is blocking on. So you can use many
goroutines to do the work, use a single goroutine to receive the results of
each task and collect them. And once all results have been received, send the
final result to main. This could be done with a set of unbuffered channels.
@Jan Christoph Uhde I hope that helps!
